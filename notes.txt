make basic reactor game
each voxel has state {
    temprature: u32, K
    presure: u32, Pa
    charge: u32, C
}

each voxel constants at STP {
    generateing: Option<u32>,
    e_conductivity: u32,
    t_conductivity: u32,
    melting_point: u32,
    srength: u32,
    mass: u32,
}

mesurments {
    voltage: dif in charge,
    presure: dif between min and max neigbor
    amps: change in charge last tick
    temprature: just read value
}
